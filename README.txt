
"MouseSupport"
================
Author: Max Vollmer

This is a Mod for the game "Phoenotopia Awakening" available on Steam.

The mod adds mouse support for the slingshot and inventory menu.

How to Install:
You need to install Unity Mod Manager first: https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21/
In Unity Mod Manager select "Phoenotopia Awakening" or "Phoenotopia Awakening Demo". If you haven't done already, select the game folder, and click "Install". (See Unity Mod Manager guides for more info.)
Then go to "Mods" => "Install Mod" and select the PhoenotopiaMouseSupport.zip file.

Inventory:
You can drag&drop items with the mouse, open the context menu, and use items with the mouse.
The mod also adds a convenient sort button and a trash bin to the inventory.

Slingshot:
You can enable or disable slingshot support. If enabled, the slingshot will always aim at your mouse cursor.

On first use you might have to re-bind your mouse inputs for ingame controls in the input menu.
